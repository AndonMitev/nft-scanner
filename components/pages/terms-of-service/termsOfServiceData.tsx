          nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to
          the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
          provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. No waiver
          will be effective against OPN unless made in writing, and no such
          waiver will be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent
          instance.

          Except as expressly agreed in writing between OPN and you, these Terms
          constitutes the entire agreement between OPN and you with respect to
          the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous
          agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect
          to the subject matter; provided, that you may also be subject to
          additional terms and conditions that are applicable to certain parts
          of the Site as aforementioned. You may not assign these Terms or any
          of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our express
          written consent. These Terms inure to the benefit of OPN’s successors,
          assigns and licensees.
